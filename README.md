# Flashcard Countdown Motivator

TLDR: A visual countdown for the flashcard UI that motivates you to not spend too much time on each individual card but move to the next card as soon as a given time is expired.

## Why/Idea

**problem**: when doing flashcards it can happen that

    1. you lose yourself in your thoughts, or
    2. you try to remember the card for too long without success

- **context**: ideally every flashcard only takes a few seconds. A workaround is to manually write down how many cards you went through in the last 10 minutes and try to continually get through as many cards as possible in 10 minutes.
  **solution**: You need some kind of visual or audio reminder to keep on studying i.e. 1. either marketing the card as forgotten or 2. moving to the next card. - setting input for max time per card - visual: bubble that keeps getting smaller as the time runs out - audio: voice countdown from X second - option: auto-mark card as forgotten if countdown ended
- what do you think?
